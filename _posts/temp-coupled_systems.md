excerpt: Networks that are constrained by some geometry and are embedded in two-or three dimensional space can be thought of as spatial networks. The constraints that space imposes can have important effects on their topological properties and in the processes which take place on them. Here we explore centrality measures of the metro systems of London, New York, Chicago, and Santiago de Chile. The time-weighted graphs were constructed using publicly available GTFS data and visualized using javascript.

<h2><b>Measuring Robustness of Transport Systems</b></h2>

In my previous post on [Transport Networks](https://mateoneira.github.io/transport_networks/){:target="_pageblank"} I talked about how network science provides useful tools and methos to analyze complex systems. Particularly, in the blog post I talked about how we can represent transport networks as temporally weighted primal graphs, and analyzed four different tranpost networks (London's, New York's, Chicago's, and Santiago de Chile's underground transit systems) in terms of their betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and degree. 

Here we explore these four networks further by inilizing their robustness. Robustness refers to the ability of a system to maintain its stability despide disruption at a local level. In other words, it is the ability of system to function even if one of its components fail. When analizing the transport networks are interest is to see if the disruption of one of its stations causes mayor disruptions at a global level. We explore this through the analysis of global disruption caused by attacks on critical nodes and random failures.
