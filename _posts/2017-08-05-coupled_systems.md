<h2><b>Measuring Robustness of Transport Systems</b></h2>

In my previous post on [Transport Networks](https://mateoneira.github.io/transport_networks/){:target="_pageblank"} I talked about how network science provides useful tools and methods to analyze complex systems. Particularly, in the blog post I talked about how we can represent transport networks as temporally weighted primal graphs, and analyzed four different transport networks (London's, New York's, Chicago's, and Santiago de Chile's underground transit systems) in terms of their betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and degree.

Here we explore these four networks further by initializing their robustness. Robustness refers to the ability of a system to maintain its stability despite disruption at a local level. In other words, it is the ability of system to function even if one of its components fail. When analyzing the transport networks our interest is to see if the disruption of one of its stations causes major disruptions at a global level. We explore this through the analysis of global disruption caused by attacks on critical nodes and random failures.
