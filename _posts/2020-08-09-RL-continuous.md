Implementation of DDPG algorithm to train an agent to solve Unity's Reacher environment. The implementation uses a 20 agent environment, the environment is considered solved if the mean reward across the 20 agents is >30 for 100 consecutive episodes. The implementation of DDPG solved the environment in 120 episodes.
