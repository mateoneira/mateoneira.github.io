<h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
Data Scientist and Developer at [SignalBox](http://www.signalbox.tech/), working on technology for data analysis and algorithm development for positioning and context detection on mobile devices targeted to work on transport systems. 

I am also pursuing an MSc. at the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis in UCL](http://mscsmartcities.org/){:target="_blank"}, studying spatial data science, geospatial analytics, and complexity. Prior to this, I worked as a junior researcher at [llactaLAB](https://llactalab.ucuenca.edu.ec/){:target="_blank"}. 

My interest broadly revolves around cities as systems of interaction, looking at coupled transport systems and their influence of patterns of interactions, particularly temporal-weighted multilayered transport networks and their relation to urban morphology, sustainability, and resilience. 

You can find my full resume [here]({{site.url}}/assets/cv_mneira.pdf).

<h2><b>PROJECTS</b></h2>
<h2>Analyzing Transport Networks</h2> 
Interactive Web tool to explore centrality measures of the metro systems of London, New York, Chicago, and Santiago de Chile. The time-weighted graphs were constructed using publicly available GTFS data and visualized using javascript. Click on the image to view the tool, along with a more indepth description.

<h2>placeSpace</h2> 
[placeSpace](http://placespace.org/){:target="_blank"} is an interactive online platform that enables users to visualize and explore amenity location and distribution in London. The platform originates from the need to interpret and assess the complexity of cities in terms of agglomeration economies.

<h2>urbanPulse</h2>
Our collective activities in the city unfold in time and space in a repeating fashion. These cyclic patterns of actions and interactions create a particular rythm, an urban 'Pulse' influenced by socio-cultural and physical aspects of our environment. 

Increasingly people use online networks to interact, and even though these interactions are virtual, they take place in physical space. By retreiving the digital traces they leave behind we can visualize these cyclic spatio-temporal patterns in a city.
