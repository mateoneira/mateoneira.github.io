<h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
I am a grad student at the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis in UCL](http://mscsmartcities.org/){:target="_blank"}, studying spatial data science, geospatial analytics, and complexity. Prior to this, I worked as a junior researcher at [llactaLAB](https://llactalab.ucuenca.edu.ec/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research interest broadly revolves around cities as systems of interaction. Particulary looking at multilayered social networks embedded in time and space to understand the influence of urban morphology on behaviour and its relationship to sustainability and resilience. 

You can find my full resume [here]({{site.url}}/assets/cv_mneira.pdf).

<h2>placeSpace</h2> 
[placeSpace](http://placespace.org/){:target="_blank"} is an interactive online platform that enables users to visualize and explore amenity location and distribution in London. The platform originates from the need to interpret and assess the complexity of cities in terms of agglomeration economies.

<h2>urbanPulse</h2>
Our collective activities in the city unfold in time and space in a repeating fashion. These cyclic patterns of actions and interactions create a particular rythm, an urban 'Pulse' influenced by socio-cultural and physical aspects of our environment. 

Increasingly people use online networks to interact, and even though these interactions are virtual, they take place in physical space. By retreiving the digital traces they leave behind we can visualize these cyclic spatio-temporal patterns in a city.
