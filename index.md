Hi, I'm Mateo. 

<h1>I build ML systems for complex environments.</h1>

I’m a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** at [Vu.City](https://www.vu.city/) and an **Honorary Research Fellow** at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/).

I specialize in **spatial** and **graph-structured data**, moving between academic research and production engineering. My work focuses on turning high-dimensional, messy data into models and systems that can survive contact with the real world.


I have a research background in **Network Science and Urban Analytics** (PhD, [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/) / [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)), where I studied how network structure and information shape human behaviour in cities. Since then, I’ve spent much of my time bridging the gap between research and production: designing, building, and deploying data and ML systems inside practice-driven environments.

I have spent my career applying that rigor to industry. Previously, as an Associate Partner at [Foster and Partners](https://www.fosterandpartners.com/), I led the deployment of data-driven tools that influenced urban design at scale. Before that, I developed transport algorithms at [SignalBox](https://www.signalbox.io/).

My work is defined by synthesis: taking ideas from papers, prototypes, or whiteboards and translating them into **robust, scalable systems** across data pipelines, modelling, and product integration. I’m comfortable operating end-to-end, from experimental work to engineering decisions and stakeholder alignment.

I’m especially interested in problems involving:
- spatial and graph-structured data  
- long feedback loops and real-world constraints  
- systems where technical choices meaningfully shape decisions

<h2><b>PROJECTS</b></h2>
<h2>Analyzing Transport Networks</h2> 
Interactive Web tool to explore centrality measures of the metro systems of London, New York, Chicago, and Santiago de Chile. The time-weighted graphs were constructed using publicly available GTFS data and visualized using javascript. Click on the image to view the tool, along with a more indepth description.

<h2>placeSpace</h2> 
[placeSpace](https://placespace.mateoneira.com/){:target="_blank"} is an interactive online platform that enables users to visualize and explore amenity location and distribution in London. The platform originates from the need to interpret and assess the complexity of cities in terms of agglomeration economies.

<h2>urbanPulse</h2>
Our collective activities in the city unfold in time and space in a repeating fashion. These cyclic patterns of actions and interactions create a particular rhythm, an urban 'Pulse' influenced by socio-cultural and physical aspects of our environment.

Increasingly people use online networks to interact, and even though these interactions are virtual, they take place in physical space. By retrieving the digital traces they leave behind we can visualize these cyclic spatio-temporal patterns in a city.
